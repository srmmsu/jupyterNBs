# jupyterNBs
A repository of Jupyter notebooks
Hello, I am trying to promote the use of JuPyter notebooks for teaching and research at our Institution.
I am trying to collect a few interesting examples of notebooks with attractive Engineering problems for
convincing my colleagues. Any suggestions and help are welcome.
